{"tagline":"Real-time sync for impress.js presentations","body":"### What is impressR exactly?\r\njquery.impressR.js is a plugin that enables any impress.js presentation to be viewed in real-time by all connected clients. It's a simple way to sync the presentation experience, and it requires zero server side integration because it leverages the [jquery.signalRamp.js](https://github.com/TimHeckel/SignalRamp) plugin and the [SignalGrr](https://github.com/TimHeckel/SignalGrr) proxy server powered by [SignalR](https://github.com/SignalR/SignalR) to do all the heavy lifting. \r\n\r\n### Live Demo\r\nClick [here](example.html) to see it in action!\r\n\r\n### How do I use it?\r\nAll you have to do is add these files to your <head>:\r\n\r\n```\r\n<script src=\"//ajax.aspnetcdn.com/ajax/jQuery/jquery-1.7.1.min.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"js/jquery.signalR-1.0.0.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"js/jquery.signalRamp.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"js/jquery.impressR.js\"></script>\r\n<script src=\"js/impress.js\"></script>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThen, in your HTML, wire up your impress.js presentations this way:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$(\"#impress\").impressR({\r\n   proxyName: 'myImpressDemo' //MUST be unique for your collaboration experience\r\n}); \r\n```\r\n\r\nThat's it! Same awesome impress.js presentation, it's just synced across all clients.","google":"UA-35769235-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
